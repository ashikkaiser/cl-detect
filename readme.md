- [cloudflare-ip](https://github.com/danneu/cloudflare-ip) - a lot of the code for verifying that the host's IP address is within Cloudflare's range has been adapted from this repo (which doesn't seem to be maintained anymore) by [danneu](https://github.com/danneu).
- [is-reachable](https://github.com/sindresorhus/is-reachable) - some of the IP verification & DNS lookup code, as well as the format of the readme file, has been adapted from this repo by [sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus).
